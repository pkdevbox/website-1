<p>I have used this at our College (Brislington Enterprise College, UK) for about 5 years on ~600 laptops and PCs, and would recommend it to anyone. I have previously used WDS, Ghost and a few others etc, and FOG wins hands down. I've never had a problem with it that wasn't fixed by a quick google search (unlike all the others). Yes it lacks the odd feature, but so do the others. this is the one to use. Keep up the good work. ~ jimchufff</p>

<p>Fog is a fantastic product. We are a regional library in Queensland Australia and have to run on a very small budget. We have FOG running at 2 sites, with the location patch, image replication over the internet and imaging from local servers. It has been a real timesaver. Thanks so much for developing it.  ~Mark</p>

<p>FOG is THE solution for images and management!! From my home LAN to my school LAN of ~600!! With everything from imaging, automatic joining of the domain, printer management, and deployment of programs (snap-ins) this application is nothing short of a miracle!! Thank you so much to the FOG development team!! ~triplej057</p>
