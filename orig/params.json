FOG can image and manage all of them. Simply set up a FOG node in each of your building.\r\n\r\n### Off Site Support\r\nNeed to manage computers that aren't in company offices? No problem, computers can be managed whever there is internet. \r\n\r\n### Support\r\nFOG is built around an active community. If you encounter a problem or just have questions post on the forums and get a response almost immediately. Not only will you have access to others who use FOG but also direct access to the development team who interact with the community daily.\r\n\r\n### Flexibility\r\nWant to customize FOG to meet your enviornment? That is not only possible but encouraged, because FOG is open source you have complete control over your server. Get in touch with a developer by posting on the forums.

The next stable release will include a new secuirty system that ensures server & client trust. Both the client and the server will communicate using a secure socket tunnel encrypted using RSA, AES, and certificate pinning.\r\n\r\n### Testimonies \r\n\r\n>I have used this at our College (Brislington Enterprise College, UK) for about 5 years on ~600 laptops and PCs, and would recommend it to anyone. I have previously used WDS, Ghost and a few others etc, and FOG wins hands down. I've never had a problem with it that wasn't fixed by a quick google search (unlike all the others). Yes it lacks the odd feature, but so do the others. this is the one to use. Keep up the good work. ~ jimchufff\r\n***\r\n\r\n>Fog is a fantastic product. We are a regional library in Queensland Australia and have to run on a very small budget. We have FOG running at 2 sites, with the location patch, image replication over the internet and imaging from local servers. It has been a real timesaver. Thanks so much for developing it.  ~Mark\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>FOG is THE solution for images and management!! From my home LAN to my school LAN of ~600!! With everything from imaging, automatic joining of the domain, printer management, and deployment of programs (snap-ins) this application is nothing short of a miracle!! Thank you so much to the FOG development team!! ~triplej057\r\n***\r\n\r\nRead more [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/reviews?source=navbar)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
